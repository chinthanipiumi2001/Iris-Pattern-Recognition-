# Iris-Pattern-Recognition-
|| Using MATLAB ||

Iris recognition stands as one of the most reliable and secure biometric authentication methods, leveraging the unique patterns found in the human iris. This repository hosts a collection of algorithms, models, and resources aimed at efficiently identifying and analyzing these intricate iris patterns for authentication and identification purposes.

There are three types used :
1. K Means
2. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
3. Neural network 

Within these digital walls, you'll find a diverse array of projects encompassing various stages of the iris recognition pipeline. From image preprocessing and feature extraction to sophisticated matching algorithms and validation methodologies, our contributors have crafted comprehensive implementations using popular libraries and cutting-edge techniques.
